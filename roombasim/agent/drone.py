    =========================
    Simplified drone physics:
    =========================

    To control 2d position relative to the origin, the
    drone can control xy_accel and yaw_vel:

    - xy_accel is a 2d vector corresponding to the 2d 
    acceleration vector in the drone's reference frame. So 
    a vector of [0, 1] would correspond to the drone accelerating 
    in 2d space at a rate of 1 m/s^2 in the direction of its
    current yaw. This vector is rotated about the origin
    by the yaw in order to calculate xy_vel and xy_pos which
    are both in the global reference frame.

    - yaw_vel is a value corresponding to the current angular
    velocity of the drone. It is asssumed, therefore that the 
    drone has infinite angular acceleration and can set an
    instataneous angular velocity.

    To control altitude, the drone can control z_vel:

    - z_vel is a value corresponding to the 1d velocity
    parameter in the z direction. In this way, the z axis of
    motion is completely disconected from the xy axes which
    makes simulating motion quite a bit simpler.
